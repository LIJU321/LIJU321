#Equation using Pyhton

def eq(a,b): # colon is needed to terminate the function..
    x = a**2+2*a*b+b**2 # this is (a+b)**2 in expanded form to calculate equation.
    
    return x # this makes the value of the variable x ultimately the function value .. of eq = x now


print(eq(4,9))# and prints eq with actual parameters beacus of return function eq function has now holds the x value and prints it..

#(a+b)**2 is same as (a+b)(a+b) means (a+b) multiplied twice how many times its sqaured or power if its (a+b)**3 == (a+b)(a+b)(a+b)== mutliply first a with all variables then b with alll same until all done add it
